title: "Introducing Capital Friction to Spatial DSGE Model"
collection: research
permalink: /research/research-4
excerpt: 'I am working as an independent researcher advised by Professor Zhiwei Xu at Fudan University to conduct this research (Feb 2024 - ).   

This work is based on the dynamic spatial general equlibrium model developed by B. Kleinman, E. Liu and S. J. Redding (2023). I try to incorporate capital frictions including liquidity constraints and monetary assets into household decisions and construct a DSGE model to examine the impact and impulse response to the spatial distribution of trade and migration. The methods I'm using include Bellman equation iteration, dynamic exact hat algebra, spectral analysis, and etc.'
